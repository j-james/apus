# apus: a miniature web browser

apus (from _Gigantochloa apus_: the most common bamboo species on the island of Java) is a local web browser.
It will parse and display HTML, Markdown, epub, and potentially other XML-based file formats.
Hopefully nobody outside of this class will use it because it will be a standards-failing web browser written in Java Swing.

This project is of interest to me because I enjoy writing parsers and have been meaning to play around with text and image rendering.
I've heard that Java Swing has a native HTML rendering component. I hope to entirely disregard this, and instead reimplement it poorly.
